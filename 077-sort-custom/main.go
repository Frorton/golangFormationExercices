/*
The stability of a sorting algorithm refers to preserving the order of duplicate values.
In a stable sort by age:

	{"James",32},{"Joe",20},{"Mark",20}

becomes,

	{"Joe",20},{"Mark",20},{"James",32}

Joe and Mark keep their relative position


In an unstable sort, this can happen:

	{"James",32},{"Joe",20},{"Mark",20}

becomes,

	{"Mark",20},{"Joe",20},{"James",32}

Mark and Joe switched positions, but the list is still sorted.
